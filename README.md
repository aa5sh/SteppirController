Steppir Controller

This is a basic application to work with my Stepir Antenna Contoller. It has been tested on my Macs with both SDA-100 and SDA-2000 controllers.

It will communication directly to the Data Out port using an appropriate Serial Cable or will operate over a network with a Serial to TCP device.
